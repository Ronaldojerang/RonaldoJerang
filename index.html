    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I’m a computer science undergrad at the National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh. I am actively -seeking Machine
      Learning internship/job opportunities. I am passionate about learning new technologies and broadening my horizons in the 
      field of AI/machine learning industry. • I am very much interested in innovative and research work,I've developed 
      machine learning algorithms using ML libraries like Tensorflow and Keras as well as a number of additional machine learning methods to generate models. • I was also the main coordinator for our college tech-fest, “Addovedi” 2022, where I supervised all the coordinators to successfully organize the events. This experience really helped me improve my communication as well as my teamwork skills. I believe with hard work and consistency, nothing is unachievable.</p>

             <h3>Maximizing Edge Intelligence with Federated Learning Optimization</h3>
            <p> Pioneered a federated approach for gradient updates, catering to edge-based model requirements. 
              Achieved logarithmic scaling (log(n)) for model selection and sharing at the edge. 
              Through comprehensive analysis, achieved a substantial 14% improvement rate in the initial phase and 3% 
              in the final phase. Successfully reduced initial phase overhead by 2.5% and maintained a minimal 0.69% reduction 
              in subsequent phases.</p>

        <div class="publication">

             <h3>Privacy-Preserving of Edge Intelligence using Homomorphic Encryption</h3>
            <p> Study to increase the edge system's efficiency when dealing with real-time encryption. 
              Utilizing an unique edge intelligence approach for the IoT device to distribute data more fluidly and encrypt it with more safety. 
              The federated learning will employ many machine learning models at the system's edge, yet the data training and everything will be Protected.</p>
