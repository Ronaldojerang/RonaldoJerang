    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I’m a computer science undergrad at the National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh. I am actively -seeking Machine Learning internship/job opportunities. I am passionate about learning new technologies and broadening my horizons in the field of AI/machine learning industry. • I am very much interested in innovative and research work,I've developed machine learning algorithms using ML libraries like Tensorflow and Keras as well as a number of additional machine learning methods to generate models. • I was also the main coordinator for our college tech-fest, “Addovedi” 2022, where I supervised all the coordinators to successfully organize the events. This experience really helped me improve my communication as well as my teamwork skills. I believe with hard work and consistency, nothing is unachievable.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
             <h3>Maximizing Edge Intelligence with Federated Learning Optimization</h3>
            <p> Pioneered a federated approach for gradient updates, catering to edge-based model requirements. Achieved logarithmic scaling (log(n)) for model selection and sharing at the edge.</p>
            <p> Through comprehensive analysis, achieved a substantial 14% improvement rate in the initial phase and 3% in the final phase.</p>
            <p> Successfully reduced initial phase overhead by 2.5% and maintained a minimal 0.69% reduction in subsequent phases.</p>
