    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a computer science undergrad at the National Institute of Technology, Arunachal
Pradesh. I am actively -seeking Machine Learning internship/job opportunities. I
am passionate about learning new technologies and broadening my horizons in
the field of AI/machine learning industry.
• I am very much interested in innovative and research work,I've developed machine
learning algorithms using ML libraries like Tensorflow and Keras as well as a
number of additional machine learning methods to generate models.
• I was also the main coordinator for our college tech-fest, “Addovedi” 2022, where I
supervised all the coordinators to successfully organize the events. This experience
really helped me improve my communication as well as my teamwork skills. I
believe with hard work and consistency, nothing is unachievable.</p>
